# AIRFALL — Evaluation

## Overall Entertainment: 8/10

The core gameplay loop — aim a leaf blower, watch ping pong balls float and swirl, try to land them on shelves — is genuinely engaging for the full 60-second round. Unlike burst-spectacle concepts (avalanche drop, single launch), AIRFALL provides continuous player control with continuous feedback. You squeeze, balls move. You aim, balls drift. You overshoot, balls cascade off a shelf. The cause-and-effect loop is tight and sustained.

The M18 blower itself is a significant part of the entertainment. For a kid, holding a real power tool that makes a real roar and has visible real-time effects is a rush. The weight of the blower, the trigger feel, the noise — this is multisensory in a way that pulling a rope or pressing a button isn't.

**Strengths:** Continuous action for the full round. No passive phases — the player is always doing something. The trigger pulsing skill mechanic emerges naturally. Two players' air streams interacting creates unpredictable, entertaining collisions in the center.

**Weaknesses:** The game is essentially the same thing for 60 seconds straight — aim and blast. There's no phase change, no escalation, no "moment." Compare to Cascade Chaos, which has a distinct setup phase and then the avalanche payoff. The gameplay intensity is flat — it starts at a 7 and stays there, never spiking to 10. The blower novelty bumps the overall player experience to an 8 on first play, but the "wow, I'm holding a leaf blower" wears off by the second round for repeat players. Some kids may disengage after 30 seconds if they're not competitive by nature. The lack of a climactic moment means the crowd experience is weak — spectators see two kids pointing leaf blowers at a box and balls bouncing around inside. It's interesting, not electrifying.

## Memorability: 7/10

"The game where you use leaf blowers to blow ping pong balls onto shelves" is a memorable sentence. Kids will retell it. The Waterfuls connection is real — anyone who played the handheld toy as a kid will immediately get it, and the scale-up from palm-sized to 6-feet-tall is inherently impressive.

The M18 blowers are a differentiator. No school carnival game puts a power tool in a kid's hands. That alone makes it a story.

However: once you strip the blower novelty, the underlying game is "put ball on shelf with air." It's a skill game, not a spectacle game. Nobody takes a video of someone carefully aiming a leaf blower. The visual from 15 feet away is: box with white dots moving around inside it. Ping pong balls are small (40mm) and white — they lack the visual pop of larger, colorful balls in a bigger field. A parent walking past may not even register what's happening unless they stop and look closely.

Not a 9 or 10 because the game doesn't create a moment that transcends the booth. A 10 would be something that people outside the gym are talking about. This is something that people at the booth are talking about.

## Ease of Construction: 5/10

The cabinet is straightforward — plywood box with an acrylic front, shelves inside. A competent woodworker builds this in a weekend. But the blower port system is a genuine engineering challenge.

**The hard parts:**
- The ball-and-socket funnel mount is the complexity bottleneck. It needs to be smooth enough to aim, stiff enough not to rattle from blower vibration, sealed enough that balls can't escape, and durable enough for 200+ rounds. This is a 3D-printed precision assembly that will require 2-3 design iterations to get right. Most dad-workshop 3D printers can do it, but dialing in the tolerances takes time.
- Cutting 3" holes in polycarbonate without cracking it requires specific drill bits (stepped unibit or hole saw at low RPM with tape). One wrong move cracks the $90 panel.
- The trapdoor reset system (9 hinged shelf bottoms linked by cable to a single pull handle) is mechanically complex. Routing cable through the back of a 6-foot-tall cabinet with 9 branch points that all need to open simultaneously is plumber-level work. If one cable sticks, the reset jams. The simpler alternative (3 separate pull handles) triples volunteer effort per reset.
- The TPU flexible seal boots require a dual-material 3D printer or separate TPU prints that interface with PLA parts. Most home printers can do TPU, but it's finicky.

**Compared to the field:** The OG Air Plinko has the blower/hose/nozzle system, which is also non-trivial, but it uses commodity parts (flex hose, PVC). AIRFALL's funnel-socket system is custom-engineered. Cascade Chaos needs steel sheet work but no precision 3D prints. AIRFALL's build complexity is above average for the repo.

**Two dads, two weekends reality:** They'll get the cabinet done Weekend 1. Weekend 2 will be mostly spent on the blower port system, swearing at 3D print tolerances, and debugging the trapdoor cable routing. It's achievable but tight.

## Appeal by Elementary School Grade

### K–1st: 4/10

The M18 blower weighs 3.5 lbs (compact model) or 5.2 lbs (full-size). A kindergartner weighs 40-50 lbs. Holding a 3.5-5 lb tool at waist height, pressing it against a port, and controlling a variable-speed trigger for 60 seconds is not physically realistic for a 5-year-old. Their arms will tire after 15-20 seconds. They'll drop the blower or rest it on the platform edge and lose all aim control. This isn't "hard mode" — it's functionally unplayable without a volunteer co-holding the blower.

The trigger mechanic — gentle squeeze vs full blast — requires fine motor control that kindergartners are still developing. Most will just squeeze full-on and watch balls fly everywhere. This is still fun (chaos is always fun), but they're not really playing the game — they're experiencing the game. The difference matters.

A volunteer will need to co-hold the blower for the youngest kids, which ties up the volunteer (can't run the timer, can't reset, can't explain to the next kid in line), slows throughput to half speed, and makes the kid feel like they need help rather than empowered. A game where the youngest 20% of your audience needs physical assistance to participate is a game with an accessibility problem.

### 2nd–3rd: 8/10

Sweet spot. Strong enough to hold the blower. Developing enough fine motor skills to experiment with trigger control. Old enough to understand "aim at that shelf" and young enough to be thrilled by the power tool experience. They'll discover trigger pulsing by accident and feel like geniuses. Competitive mode works — they'll trash-talk about who got the gold ball on the 100 shelf.

### 4th–5th: 7/10

They'll master the mechanics quickly and appreciate the skill ceiling (trigger control, aim precision, timing around the opponent's air stream). But some 5th graders may feel the game is "just blowing balls around" once the novelty of the blower wears off. The lack of strategic depth beyond "aim better" could underwhelm kids who want more decision-making. Compare to Cascade Chaos where deflector placement provides strategic richness.

## Skill to Luck Spectrum: 8/10 (heavily skill)

This is AIRFALL's strongest dimension. Unlike plinko variants where you launch and hope, here you have direct, continuous, real-time control for the entire round. The variable-speed trigger is a genuine skill axis:
- Full blast: balls launch high but scatter unpredictably
- Half trigger: balls rise gently, more controllable
- Pulse: precision placement — burst to lift, release to let settle

Aim direction adds a second skill axis. Sweeping left puts balls on left shelves. Angling up reaches higher shelves but with less precision. The ball-and-socket mount's 30° range gives meaningful choice.

**Why not 9 or 10:** Two confounding factors reduce skill expression. First, the opponent's air stream introduces unpredictable turbulence — a perfectly aimed ball gets knocked sideways by the other player's jet. Second, ball-on-ball collisions are random. When 40 balls are in play and two air streams are crossing, the center of the cabinet becomes a turbulence zone where skill gives way to chaos. A player who "should" score higher based on aim skill might lose because of unlucky ball-ball interactions. Over many rounds, skill dominates. In a single carnival round, a lucky kid can beat a skilled one maybe 25% of the time.

## Chaos Level: 6/10

Counterintuitively low for a game with leaf blowers. The action is continuous but relatively contained — balls float and drift rather than slamming and ricocheting. Ping pong balls at 2.7g don't hit hard enough to create violent rebounds. The visual is more "snow globe" than "explosion." There are chaotic moments — when a shelf gets bumped and 3 balls cascade down through the field, disrupting other balls — but the baseline state is balls gently hovering and drifting in air columns.

The noise is chaotic (two leaf blowers = loud), but the visual chaos is moderate. Compare to Cascade Chaos (50 balls avalanching simultaneously through steel pegs = visual bedlam) or Flipper Frenzy (6 balls pinballing off bumpers with sound effects). AIRFALL is calmer than it sounds. This is fine — sustained medium chaos beats brief maximum chaos for actual gameplay — but it means the game doesn't draw a crowd by being visually overwhelming.

## Durability: 7/10

**What will survive:** The plywood cabinet is robust. Polycarbonate front panel is impact-resistant (better than acrylic for this application). Shelves are simple wood. The M18 blowers are built for construction sites — a day at a school carnival is nothing.

**What might fail:** Ping pong balls will crack. At 2.7g hitting acrylic and wood shelves at blower speeds, expect 5-10 balls to crack per hour of play. With 20 spares and 3-second swaps, this is manageable but requires the volunteer to periodically check for cracked balls and swap them. A cracked ball with a ragged edge could jam in the funnel port mesh — if this happens, the game stops until the volunteer clears it.

The ball-and-socket blower mount will wear. After 200+ insertions and removals of blower nozzles, the socket surface will develop slop. If 3D-printed in PLA, it may crack at stress points after ~500 cycles. PETG would last longer. The TPU boot will stretch over time. Bring a spare set of funnel assemblies.

Battery management is a real operational concern. Two M18 5.0Ah batteries last ~20 minutes of continuous use. At 60 seconds on, 30 seconds off, that's ~13 rounds per battery pair. Over a 4-hour carnival, you need ~18 battery swaps. With 4 batteries and a charger, you need charge times shorter than depletion times. M18 rapid charger does 5.0Ah in 45 minutes. Math works out, but the volunteer needs to remember battery rotation. A dead battery mid-round = dead game until swap.

## Photogenicity: 4/10

This is AIRFALL's weakest dimension and it drags the whole concept down.

Ping pong balls are small (40mm) and white. Inside a cabinet with a black interior, they're visible in person but don't photograph well through the polycarbonate front panel. The panel will reflect overhead gym lighting — parents trying to take photos will get glare more often than not. From the side, you can't see the balls at all (solid wood panels). A standard plinko board with colorful balls visible from 20 feet away photographs better than this.

The best photo angle is straight-on through the acrylic, from 3-4 feet away. But that's where the players are standing with their blowers. You can't photograph the game in action without including the back of a kid's head and a leaf blower blocking half the view.

The blowers themselves are visually interesting (bright Milwaukee red/black), and two kids holding power tools is a fun photo. But the actual gameplay — balls drifting inside a box — doesn't read on camera. Compare this to Cascade Chaos (50 colorful balls avalanching through a peg field = instant visual drama) or Flipper Frenzy (neon bumpers, visible ball paths, loud mechanical action).

Video is slightly better than photos — the motion of balls floating and cascading shows up in video where a still photo just captures white dots on black. But even video from more than 6 feet away won't capture the detail.

**To improve:** Use colored LED strip lighting inside the cabinet (UV blacklight + fluorescent balls would be dramatic, but adds cost and complexity). Larger balls would help but would change the floating physics.

## Onboarding Time: 9/10 (~10 seconds)

"Point the leaf blower at the hole and squeeze the trigger. Get as many balls on the shelves as you can. Higher shelves = more points. Go."

That's it. The game is immediately intuitive. Every kid knows what a leaf blower does. The connection between "blow air" and "balls move" requires zero explanation. The only nuance (trigger control) is discovered during play, not taught before it.

This is faster to explain than any other concept in the repo. Cornhole-level simplicity with more depth hiding underneath. A parent volunteer who just arrived can explain this game in one sentence.

## Verdict

AIRFALL is a skill game with a strong gimmick. The core mechanic — aim a leaf blower to float ping pong balls onto shelves — is immediately intuitive, continuously engaging, and has a real skill ceiling. The Waterfuls nostalgia connection works for the parents, and the M18 blowers are a differentiator no other carnival game offers. But "strong gimmick" and "great carnival game" aren't the same thing.

**The core tension:** The game's greatest strength (continuous skill-based control) is also its entertainment ceiling. There's no "moment" — no avalanche, no flipper save, no buzzer-beater. It's 60 seconds of the same thing at the same intensity. For the player, this is great. For the crowd, this is a bunch of white dots bouncing around in a box while two kids point leaf blowers at it. The spectator experience is genuinely weak.

**The photogenicity problem is real.** In 2026, if a carnival game doesn't photograph well, it doesn't generate social media word-of-mouth. AIRFALL is fun to play and boring to photograph. This matters for a school carnival where parent Facebook posts drive future attendance.

**The K-1st exclusion is meaningful.** If 20% of your carnival audience can't physically hold the blower without volunteer help, you're creating a bottleneck and an inequity. A game that's "for 2nd graders and up" is a game that makes some kindergartners feel left out.

**Build this if:** You already own M18 blowers, you have a 3D printer and aren't afraid of iterating on precision parts, you want the highest skill-to-luck ratio in the repo, and you can accept that the spectator/photo experience is below average.

**Don't build this if:** You need a game that draws a crowd from across the gym, you need to serve K-1st graders equally, you don't own M18 blowers (buying them doubles the cost), or your build team isn't comfortable with 3D-printed precision assemblies.

**Compared to the field:** Strongest skill game in the repo. Weakest spectator game. The Waterfuls nostalgia angle and power tool novelty carry the memorability, but the visual modesty of ping pong balls in a cabinet keeps this from being a top-tier carnival showpiece. It's a great game that makes a mediocre booth.
