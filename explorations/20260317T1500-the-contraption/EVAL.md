# THE CONTRAPTION — Carnival Game Evaluation

## Scoring Rubric
Each heuristic scored 1–10 (10 = best possible).

### Overall Entertainment: 7/10
The core loop — crank a handle, watch a ball navigate mechanical interactions — is mesmerizing to watch on YouTube. At an actual carnival with a 15-kid line in 90-degree heat, the calculus changes. Each turn takes 60+ seconds of watching a single ball navigate slowly through mechanisms. That's beautiful for the player; it's a line management nightmare for the booth volunteer. Stomp Rockets Plinko gets ~10 launches in 45 seconds with full-body action; cranking gets 8-10 in 60 seconds with one wrist. The visual payoff per ball is higher, but the throughput is lower, and throughput is what determines whether kids in line stay or leave. The hand crank adds tactile satisfaction, and the mechanisms genuinely tell micro-stories (funnel spirals, pendulum redirects, see-saw catapults). But the entertainment score has to account for the kids waiting, not just the kid playing. A game that entertains one kid beautifully while boring fourteen is a 7, not a 9.

### Memorability: 8/10
"Remember that game where the ball went through the spinning wheels and that octopus thing?" — yes, kids will remember this. The 3D-printed mechanism showcase is genuinely impressive to adults. But "no kid has ever seen a carnival game where every piece was 3D printed" mistakes the builder's pride for the player's experience. No kid cares whether something was 3D printed, injection molded, or carved from wood. They care whether it was fun. What IS memorable: the sheer mechanical density, the neon-on-black aesthetic, and the Octopus centrepiece. Those are real differentiators. The printers-at-the-booth idea is a conversation starter for parents, not kids. Scoring this relative to the full range: a standout carnival game is an 8. A 10 would be something kids bring up unprompted months later, and "I watched a ball go through some gears" is less likely to achieve that than games where the kid's own body created the action.

### Ease of Construction: 4/10
This is not a "two dads, two weekends" build. This is a multi-month engineering project. The plywood frame and scoring buckets are standard weekend work — but that's maybe 15% of the total effort. The remaining 85% is: (1) designing 11 unique 3D-printed mechanism types in CAD, each requiring iteration to work reliably with whiffle balls, (2) an Archimedes screw with tolerances tight enough to lift 2.75" balls without jamming or slipping — a mechanism that professional engineers prototype multiple times, (3) press-fit housings for 30 skateboard bearings, each needing to survive hundreds of ball impacts, (4) the Octopus: a complex multi-part assembly with 8 reconfigurable arms that must move reliably after thousands of cycles. "You have 8 weeks of print time" is optimistic framing for what is actually "you will spend 8 weeks iterating on failures." Every mechanism that doesn't work on the first print (most won't) needs redesign, reprint, and retest. Two dads who are experienced with CAD and 3D printing might pull this off if they treat it as a serious hobby project for two months. Two dads who are "comfortable with 3D printing" (i.e., they've printed some Thingiverse models) will hit a wall by week 3.

### Appeal by Elementary School Grade
| Grade | Appeal (1-10) | Notes |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| K–1st | 7/10 | The crank handle requires sustained rotational motion — harder for small hands than stomping. The visual spectacle holds attention even if their cranking is slow, and the toilet bowls get a laugh. But the passive nature (watch the ball, don't control it) limits engagement for an age group that wants to DO things |
| 2nd–3rd | 9/10 | Sweet spot. Strong enough to crank at speed, old enough to start noticing mechanism patterns, competitive enough to care about the jackpot. This age group gets the most out of the balance between visual spectacle and physical input |
| 4th–5th | 8/10 | This age group will appreciate the mechanisms more than younger kids — studying gear ratchets, trying to predict the Octopus routing. The engineering factor is real. But the gameplay itself is still passive: crank and watch. Older kids want agency, and "crank speed" as the only skill lever gets old after one turn. They'll enjoy it, but the gap between watching and doing limits repeat play |

### Skill to Luck Spectrum: 5/10 (Luck-dominant)
**Skill factors:** Crank speed determines how many balls you launch — more balls means more chances. That's the only meaningful skill lever. Timing between cranks to exploit stateful mechanisms is theoretically possible but practically meaningless with 28 mechanisms and two players' balls interacting simultaneously. No kid (or adult) can track the state of the system well enough to make strategic timing decisions.
**Luck factors:** Once the ball enters the mechanism field, the player has zero influence on the outcome. The stateful mechanisms create deterministic-but-unpredictable paths, which is elegant in theory but functionally identical to pure randomness from the player's perspective.
The honest assessment: skill is maybe 15% of the outcome (crank faster = more balls = marginally better odds). The rest is luck. This isn't necessarily bad for a carnival game — any kid can win — but it means the game is closer to a slot machine with a hand crank than a skill challenge. A 5 reflects that the balance leans heavily toward luck with only one thin skill axis.

### Chaos Level: 7/10
Multiple balls from two players navigating stateful mechanisms simultaneously does create real complexity — see-saws catapulting balls across sides, the Octopus reconfiguring arms, gear ratchets holding and releasing in bursts. The mechanical interactions are genuinely more interesting than balls bouncing off static pegs. But "chaos" implies energy and speed, and this system is slower than peg-based alternatives. Balls moving through mechanisms take predictable paths at moderate speeds. It's an intricate complex system, not pandemonium. The visual chaos is moderate: neon colors help, but balls spend time inside mechanisms (hidden from view) rather than bouncing visibly across the board. Compared to 20 balls simultaneously bouncing off pegs at speed, this is more clockwork than chaos.

### Durability: 6/10
The replaceability argument sounds good in theory: every mechanism is a print file on a laptop, break it and reprint overnight. But "overnight" doesn't help you at the carnival. Mid-event, a broken Octopus arm means a broken Octopus for the rest of the day. A seized bearing on a spinning wheel means that mechanism is dead until someone can press-fit a replacement — not a 30-second fix with kids waiting.
**Real durability concerns:** (1) PLA is brittle under repeated impact; bearing housings on spinning wheels will take hundreds of hits per carnival day. PETG helps but doesn't eliminate the problem. (2) The Archimedes screw is a single point of failure — if it jams, no balls launch, game over. (3) Complex assemblies like the Octopus have more failure modes than simple pegs. Each moving joint is a potential break point.
**Mitigation that actually works:** Print spares of every mechanism and bring them in a labeled box. But this requires pre-carnival discipline and adds to the already heavy prep burden. The plywood frame and acrylic are genuinely durable. The mechanisms themselves are the weak link — lots of moving parts means lots of things that can break.

### Photogenicity: 8/10
Twelve neon filament colors against matte black under clear acrylic is a genuinely striking color scheme, visible from across a field. The Octopus in gradient purple-to-teal, the Volcano in red-to-orange, gold Archimedes screws — the visual density is real. Close-up shots of individual mechanisms photograph well, and wide shots of the full board with balls in motion have genuine wow factor.
The honest limitation: "kinetic sculpture that plays like a game" is accurate, and that's actually the problem in a photo. Action shots of kids cranking a handle are less dynamic than kids stomping, throwing, or physically engaging with a game. The kid's body language says "turning a crank" not "playing a game." The board itself is the star, which makes for great art-installation photos but weaker gameplay photos. LED backlighting would help at nighttime events, but most school carnivals are daytime affairs in gymnasiums with fluorescent lighting — the neon-on-black aesthetic loses punch under those conditions.

### Onboarding Time: 8/10 (Fast — slightly more than cornhole)
**20-second explanation:** "Turn the crank to launch balls. Watch them bounce through the machines. The ball ends up in a bucket at the bottom — bigger number is better! Crown bucket is 1000 points. Toilet is zero. You've got 60 seconds. GO."
Kids see a giant machine and intuitively want to interact. The crank is an obvious affordance — handle = turn. The only learning curve vs. Stomp Rockets Plinko is that cranking requires understanding rotational motion (stomping is more primal/instinctive). But one practice crank and they get it. The mechanisms themselves need zero explanation — kids don't need to know HOW the pendulum works, they just watch the ball and react.

## Verdict
The Contraption scores 7.0/10. It is the most ambitious concept in the set and the most likely to fail the "two dads in a garage" constraint. Ambition is not the same as feasibility for a school carnival game.

**The core tension:** This concept is an engineering showcase first and a carnival game second. The gameplay is passive — crank a handle, watch a ball. The spectacle is real, but spectacle doesn't keep a line of 15 kids engaged when each turn takes 60+ seconds. Compare this to games where the kid's body IS the input (stomping, throwing, launching). Those create entertainment for the player and the line. A crank does not.

**The construction reality:** At 4/10 on ease of construction, this concept demands experienced CAD users, not hobbyist 3D printer owners. Designing 11 unique mechanism types that reliably interact with whiffle balls under carnival conditions is a serious mechanical engineering challenge. The Archimedes screw alone could consume weeks of prototyping. The Octopus is a multi-part assembly with 8 moving arms that need to survive thousands of cycles. "Two dads with Bambu printers" is the starting point, not the finish line — those dads also need CAD fluency, mechanical intuition, and the patience to iterate on dozens of failed prints.

**Who should build this:** Honestly, probably nobody — as a standalone carnival game. The construction burden is too high and the gameplay is too passive for the payoff. However, individual mechanisms from this concept (spinning wheels, pendulum redirectors, see-saw catapults) are excellent as drop-in upgrades to a simpler peg-based board. Print 4-5 of the most reliable mechanisms and scatter them among standard pegs. You get 80% of the visual wow at 20% of the build effort.

**When to seriously consider the full build:** Only if both builders have real CAD experience (not "willing to learn"), have already prototyped the Archimedes screw successfully by week 2, and are treating this as a passion project they'd enjoy even if the carnival got cancelled. If the motivation is "we want the best carnival game," simpler concepts score higher on the dimensions that matter most on carnival day.

**Biggest risk:** Scope. Not any single mechanism, but the aggregate complexity of 11 mechanism types, 30 bearings, a precision screw launcher, and a complex centrepiece assembly — all needing to work reliably after transport, setup by a parent volunteer, and hours of use by kids who don't read instructions. Every additional mechanism is another thing that can break, jam, or confuse the booth operator.
